* JsonSchemaValidator
This library is provides a [[https://json-schema.org/][JSON Schema]] validator, based on the current
draft 07: https://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html.

It uses the official [[https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite][JSON Schema Test Suite]]. Currently almost all normal
tests are passing, with the exception of one test of
=additionalProperties= as well as one =ref= test case. The optional
test cases have not been considered so far. 

It is very much WIP!

** Usage
The library provides a single exported procedure =validate=, which
takes both a =schema: JsonNode=, and some =data: JsonNode= to validate
against the schema. A =bool= is returned indicating whether =data= is
valid under =schema=. Currently no errors as to what parts of the
data are wrong are provided.

* JsonSchemaValidator
This library is provides a [[https://json-schema.org/][JSON Schema]] validator, based on the current
draft 07: https://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html.

It uses the official [[https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite][JSON Schema Test Suite]]. Currently almost all normal
tests are passing, with the exception of one test of
=additionalProperties= as well as one =ref= test case. The optional
test cases have not been considered so far. 

It is very much WIP!
